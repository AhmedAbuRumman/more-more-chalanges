            Cobalion is a goat-like Pok√©mon that is mainly aqua blue with eight black dots on it (four on each side). It has a light blue spiky tail and a white scruff of fluffy white fur covering its neck. Its feet are light blue with black tipped toes and a black line separating it from the aqua blue color. Its face is light blue and the top of its head is black while the rest of the head is aqua blue. It has orange eyes and two slightly jagged orange horns on the top of its head. It has orange spiked protrusions coming of its shoulders, and its rear thighs are relatively plump.
